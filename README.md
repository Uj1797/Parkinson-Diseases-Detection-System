# Parkinson-Diseases-Detection-System

This project aims to develop a predictive model for Parkinson's disease progression using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in handling complex data. By analyzing clinical data, the SVM model will predict disease progression over time. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and sensitivity will assess the model's performance, with the ultimate goal of aiding clinicians in early detection and treatment planning for Parkinson's disease.
